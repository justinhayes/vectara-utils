The first -- in terms of the operating losses, I know it's tough to answer, but should we think of the op loss accrual this quarter as you reassessing what you might have to pay in the future, or you got hit with some stuff that you didn't expect and you've already paid up? Is there some combination of those? How should we think about what happened this quarter with the op loss accrual?",

And so as we've said, we've tried to be very, very transparent that there -- that we do have things that will be lumpy, that could be significant. And it's in our best interest to get as much behind us as quickly as we possibly can.

It happened in the last cycle and will happen again here. Once the Fed stops raising rates, you will see a lag before deposit pricing stops going up, and that's just normal and to be expected. As it relates to overall NII at that point, I think there's a lot of what-ifs that need to go into that scenario.

And I think as you sort of look at the environment we're in, we just want to -- we want to be -- continue to be prudent about how and when we do -- we do buybacks.

There are swings in AOCI that have impacted many of us. There are these geopolitical risks out there which something could trigger something, which could ultimately have a broader impact on the economy.

But we're hearing from different folks that the commercial real estate market starting to tighten up, banks aren't as being as aggressive in lending. Can you -- any color on the risk dynamics that you might be seeing and trends you're seeing in commercial real estate mortgage?",
