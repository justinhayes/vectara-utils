I don't think we're going to be in an environment where the Fed is bouncing short-term funds around 1%, which I just don't think it's going to happen. I think we're going to -- I think we will get inflation under control, but I think it's going to be a struggle to get it under 3 long-term. And I think front rates will rise -- will stay higher. They might cut and likely will cut from some 5% level. But this assumption that they're going to cut, and therefore, rates are going to go back to 2 or 1, I just think is absurd.

As a practical matter, we're not wildly out of bounds in terms of -- while we're asset sensitive, we're not wildly asset sensitive.
